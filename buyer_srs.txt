III. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (November 2025)

- FR-B.1–B.3 are fulfilled through the Vue buyer marketplace pages backed by `/api/rice-marketplace/products` and the unified `/api/rice-marketplace/orders` endpoint (pre-orders included).
- FR-B.4–B.5 are covered by the rebuilt `/orders` experience, which lists real orders with live progress plus a detail view per order.
- FR-B.6 now has a dedicated conversation thread per order (buyer ↔ farmer) via `/api/rice-marketplace/orders/{order}/messages`.
- FR-B.7 is enforced across UI copy and API responses: the platform never processes payments and reminds users to settle transactions offline.
